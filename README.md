Hello. We're going to do some pair programming for the next hour or so.
As you read this, please keep in mind that the goal of this exercise is not to trick you,
or even gauge what you know (you won't be quizzed on the specifics or RSpec, and the coding problem does not require an understanding of Big O notation or graph theory). Rather, the point is to get a better unstanding of how you work, communicate, and think. We want to make sure you can be successful and happy in a highly collaborative environment like Cozy.

Instructions:
- Accept the ScreenHero invitation and get it set up. It's a really great screen sharing application.
- Clone down this repo.
- Make sure you have Ruby 2.0+ and rspec 3.0+ installed (we're using Ruby 2.2 and RSpec 3.2). You can use rbenv/RVM and bundler for this, or install into system Ruby, whatever you want. There are a few helper files already in the repo to make using a version manager and bundler easier for you.
- Logic goes in `app.rb` and specs go in `specs.rb`.

Once you're all set up, run the specs to make sure things are working:

```
$ rspec specs.rb

I'll connect to your desktop so you can drive. I'll tell you what the assignment is when it comes time to pair.
